# Game-Engine-Cpp

This project is a custom game engine made in C++ and integrading libraries such as SFML, SDL2, JSON, OpenMP and Box2D. 

The engine consist of a Main folder containing all libraries and classes. 
The SFML Server contains code of simple server application implemented using SFML, allowing multiple users to connect.

I have to say that the engine is not finished and most likely would require a lot more time to be improved.
But it was an excellent way to practice programming as it relies on design patterns and other good practices. 

I found planning and implementing really interesting as it required me to use my existing knowledge and expand it.
